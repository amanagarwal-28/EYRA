                    We started in a single workshop with a handful of designs and
                    a stubborn rule: nothing leaves unless we would wear it every
                    day ourselves. That rule threw out more prototypes than it
                    kept, and it is still the only quality gate that matters here.

                    The pieces that survived were the quiet ones. Bands you forget
                    you are wearing. Chains that layer without tangling. Earrings
                    light enough to keep in through a long day. That is the shape
                    the brand took, and we have not drifted from it.

                    hallmarked, still finished by the same hands.
